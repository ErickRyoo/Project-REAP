# REAP: Rice Efficacy Across Philippines: A Data-Driven Cross-Dataset Analysis with India

This project entails a comparative analysis between the agricultural practices of India and the Philippines, with a specific focus on rice cultivation. Python will be employed for data analytics, aiming to provide meaningful insights into the similarities and differences between these two methods. The project seeks to identify key factors contributing to the effectiveness of these practices, while highlighting areas for potential improvement.

## Introduction
Philippines is well-known for its agricultural lands. In fact, the country is even considered an agricultural country because of its favorable climate and fertile lands that support wide range of agricultural goods. 

However, despite its vast agricultural resources, it is also one of the major importers of agricultural goods. This poses a significant challenge to the country's food security and economic sustainability. While the country produces a wide variety of crops, it is still heavily reliant on imported goods such as wheat, dairy products, and meat, among others. The reasons for this include insufficient infrastructure, lack of modernization in the agricultural sector, and inadequate government support for local farmers. These issues have led to low productivity levels, high costs of production, and limited access to markets.
